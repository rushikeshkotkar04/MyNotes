Kafka :
	
	Kafka Cluater:
		-A group of kafka broker
	
	Kafka Broker:
		-A server a kafka is running
	
	Kafka Producer:
		-Produce data and put into cluster
	
	Kafka Consumer:
		-Use data put by producer
	
	Zookeeper:
		-Keeps track of kafka cluster health
		-Manages kafka cluster
	
	Kafka Kconnect:
		-To get data from external services or vice versa e.g. DB
		 without any logical code
		 source --> cluster
		 cluster --> sink
	
	Kafka Stream:
		-Functionalities to use in data transformation
		 Takes data  from cluster do some changes on data and again 
		 put inside the kafka cluster
	Topic :
		Similar to table in DB 
		
		producer put data in topics and consumer takes that.
		
		Simmilar event data store
	
	Partition:
		It is inside kafka topics
		
		To archieve distrubuted system
		
		Parts of topics
		
		Round Robin fashion
		
		actual data of topics present here
		
		ordered and immutable
	
	Partitioner:
		if key in send data it decided where to append it based on hashing and key
		
		
	Sending data in kafka topic Partition
		Key:Value
		partition:Value
		
		key is optional
		 with key ordered
		 without key order wont be maintained
	
		
		
	Consumer Offset:
		-Position of consumer in a partition means which msg i is  reading so they wont read msg again aagain
	
	Consumer Groups:
		-Group od consumer
		-Partitions are assigned in round robin fashion
	
	Segments:
		-Set of msg in partition
	
	Commit Log:
		-Actually msg store in file system called commit log
		-Msg deleted after log file reached to particular size
	
	Replication factor:
		To replicate/make copies Topics the no of Replication factor

producer -> cluster -> consumer


kafka zookeeper --> Broker --> Topic create with partition --> Producer ---> Consumer
